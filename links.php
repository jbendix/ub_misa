    <img src="pictures/cfc.jpeg">  
    <p>CFC believes in providing an equal opportunity for all children, helping to level the playing field in information technology. 
    Sixty percent of Americaâ€™s jobs require technical skills. The lack of computer access and technology programs in schools has caused 
    many children to grow up without the necessary interaction with current technologies to succees in this new environment 
    causing a major disadvantage when entering higher education or employment. Computers For Children aims to eliminate this 
    career obstacle and limitation facing those children.</p>

    <p>Formed in 1998, infoTech Niagara is a rapidly growing consortium of multi-sized software, hardware, telecommunications companies, 
    government and economic agencies, and educational institutions. The purpose of the organization is to address various 
    industry-specific issues such as workforce availability, industry image, technology transfer, networking, access to financing, and 
    attracting new business to the region. Since infoTech Niagara's formation, workforce development has been a top priority. 
    Much time and effort has been spent on related initiatives, including the formation of an Education and Workforce subcommittee; 
    internship and human resources forums; an online job databank; and working with local colleges, universities and school districts 
    to implement IT curriculums. The coalition's members serve on Buffalo's Information Technology Council, which is creating 
    "smart building" certification (electronically enhanced buildings with state-of-the-art telecommunications systems and workplace 
    automation). Others are partnering with the educational community to identity job opportunities to keep the "best and brightest" 
    in the area. InfoTech Niagara holds regular meetings at which a cross-section of business and technology issues are discussed, 
    including: technology resources; workforce retention; regional technology infrastructure; governmental policies with regard 
    to the technology industry; financial resources; funding resources; and private, business and education institutions.</p>
